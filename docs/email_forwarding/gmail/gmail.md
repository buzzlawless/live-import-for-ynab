Read these instructions on how to [import a filter](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6579#zippy=%2Cexport-or-import-filters).

Use [live_import_for_ynab_gmail_filter.xml](live_import_for_ynab_gmail_filter.xml) as the filter file, but first replace `yourdomain` with the domain you set up with Simple Email Service in the line `<apps:property name='forwardTo' value='discoverynab@yourdomain.com'/>`.
