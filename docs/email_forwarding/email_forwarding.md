# Email Forwarding

Some banks don't allow you to specify a separate email address for transaction notifications. You can still receive these notifications, but at your regular email address. You'll need to set up a rule to automatically forward these emails to your live-import-for-ynab email and then delete them from your regular email inbox.

Instructions are linked below for specific email providers. If you use another email provider, you'll need to consult their website for instructions.
